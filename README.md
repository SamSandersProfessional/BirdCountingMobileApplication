<h1>Bird Counting Mobile Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was a group task consisting of five members to create an application that would serve residents of Cape York in Australia. The application uses HTML with CSS for styling, JavaScript for simple scripts such as incrementing the like counter, JSON to store hashed passwords and a test harness to test features within the pages.
<br />


<h2>UX Principles Being Used</h2>

Performed a Heuristic Analysis of Existing Animal Wellfare and Bird Watching Sites:
[Sanders-Heuristic Usability Evaluation Findings (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23543489/Sanders-Heuristic.Usability.Evaluation.Findings.1.pdf)

Observed Local Public Spaces to Understand how Users Interact with Their Devices:

<br />

Created Personas to provide an understanding of the stakeholders within the application and the needs that are required for development:

<br />

I created Low Fidelity Paper Prototypes to Model an End User Scenario for Counting Birds Using the Application:

<br />

We Created Mid Fidelity Wireframes to Model and Test interactions with Pages of our Application:

<br />

We used this Mid Fidelity Prototype to Understand Necessary Improvements for Our Final Application:
